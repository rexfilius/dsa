**Binary  Tree** - a tree in which each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left and right children

`Common traversal operations on Binary Trees` 
In-order, Pre-order, Post-order - O(n) time and space 

`Coding problems on Binary Trees` 
1. Find the height of a binary tree
2. Serializing a binary tree


**Binary Search Treee** or BST - a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, insert and removal operations.

`Common operations on BSTs` 
insert, remove, contains(lookup) - O(log n)

`Coding problems on BST` 
1. Check if a binary tree is a BST 
2. Checks if the current tree contains all of the elements of another tree.
