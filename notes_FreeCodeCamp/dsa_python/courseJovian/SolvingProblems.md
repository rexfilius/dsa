When attempting to solve a problem, don't just go straight into coding. Here is a systematic strategy you can apply:
1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs and outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3-6.

"Applying the right technique'' is where the knowledge of common data staructures and algorithms come in handy.

An algorithm is simply a list of statements which can be converted into code and executed by a computer on different sets of inputs.
