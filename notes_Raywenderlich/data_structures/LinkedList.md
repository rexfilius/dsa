A Linked List is a collection of values arranged in a linear, unidirectional sequence.

`Common Operations in a Linked List`
1. push : adds a value at the front of a list. Head-first insertion. O(1) time
2. append : adds a value at the end of the list. Tail-end insertion. O(1) time
3. insert : adds a value after a node in the list. O(1) time
4. nodeAt : finds a node at a given index. O(i) time, i is the given index
5. pop : removes a value at the front of a list. O(1) time
6. removeLast : removes the last node in the list. O(n) time.
7. removeAfter : removes a value anywhere in the list. O(1) time.

`Variations of a Linked List`
1. A doubly linked list is a linked list in which nodes contain a reference to the previous node

`Coding Problems`
1. Reversing a linked list.
2. Finding the niddle node of the list.
3. Merge two linked list.
