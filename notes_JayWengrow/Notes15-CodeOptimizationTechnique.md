The prerequisite to optimization is determining the efficiency of your current code. After all, it’s impossible to make an algorithm faster if you don’t know how fast it is now.

Once you’ve determined the efficiency of your current algorithm come up with what you believe to be what I call the "best-imaginable Big O" (or "best-conceivable runtime" when applied to speed.)

Essentially, the best-imaginable Big O is the absolute best Big O you could dream of for the problem at hand. This is the Big O you know is absolutely impossible to beat.

Code Optimization Technique::
1. Determine the Big O category of your current algorithm. Determine the best-imaginable Big-O you could dream of for the problem at hand. If the best-imaginable Big-O is faster than your current Big-O, you can now try to optimize your code, with the goal of bringing your algorithm as close to the best imaginable Big-O as possible.
2. Magical lookups (e.g. with HashTables)
3. Recognizing patterns
4. Greedy algorithm = in each step, the algorithm chooses what appears to be the best option at that moment in time.
5. Change the Data Structure
