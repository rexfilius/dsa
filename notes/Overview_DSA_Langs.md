Map
1. Python
- it is called a 'dictionary'
- I think the default implementation is a LinkedHashMap, because insertion order is preserved in a dictionary.
2. Dart
- there is HashMap, LinkedHashMap and SplayTreeMap. 
- The default map (represented by curly braces {}) is the LinkedHashMap.
- LinkedHashMap preseves the insertion order, HashMap does not.
