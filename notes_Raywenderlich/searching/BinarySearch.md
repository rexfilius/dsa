Binary search is one of the most efficient searching algorithms with a time complexity of O(log n). 
This is comparable with searching for an element inside a balanced binary search tree. 

Two conditions need to be met before you can use binary search: 
1. The collection must be able to perform index manipulation in constant time. e.g. Array, ArrayList
2. The collection must be sorted. 

`Coding problem` 
1. Search a sorted array list and find the range of indices for a particular element.
