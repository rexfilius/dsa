an abstract data type (ADT) is the specification of a group of operations that make sense for a given data type

common abstractions
1. primitive data types - number, string, boolean
2. stack
3. queue
4. priority queue
5. list
6. sorted list
7. map or dictionary
8. set

an ADT only describes how variables of a given data type are operated. it provides a list of operations, but does not explain how data operations happen

conversely, data structures describes how data is to be organized and accessed in the computer's memory. they provide ways for implementing ADTs in data handling modules

there are different eays to implement ADTs because there are different data structures

selecting an ADT implementation that uses the bast data structure according to your needs is essential for creating efficient computer programs

Structures
1. array
2. linked list
3. double linked list
4. tree
5. binary search tree (tree balancing - red-black tree, avl tree)
6. binary heap
7. graph
8. hash table

sorting algorithms
1. selection sort
2. insertion sort
3. merge sort
4. quick sort

searching algorithms
1. sequential search
2. binary search
3. using a hash table

graphs: searching in graphs
1. depth first search (dfs)
2. breadth first search (bfs)

graph coloring problems arise when you have a fixed amount of colors (or any other set of labels), and you must assign each node in the graph, a color. nodes that are connected with an edge cannot share the same color

graphs: path finding
bfs and dfs are usable but bad. a more effective way of finding the shortest path is the 'Djikistra Algo'

graphs: PageRank
PageRank alog is used by Google to rank the importance of web pages
