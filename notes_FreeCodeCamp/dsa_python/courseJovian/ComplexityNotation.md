The field of study concerned with finding the amount of time, space or other resources required to complete the execution of computer programs is called the ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS.

The process of figuring out the best algorithm to solve a given problem is called ALGORITHM DESIGN & OPTIMIZATION.

COMPLEXITY of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size.

Unless otherwise stated, the term complexity always refers to the worst-case complexity i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the algorithm to process an input.

Design programs keeping the worst case in mind. Worst case complexity is often expressed using the Big-O notation.
