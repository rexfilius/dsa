A Stack is a LIFO data structure.

`Relevance`
Stacks are crucial to problems that search trees and graphs

`Implementation`
The ArrayList is an obvious storage choice since it offers constant time insertions and deletions at one end via 'add' & 'removeAt' with the last index as a parameter.

`Common Operations`
1. push : adds a value at the top of the stack (or end of the array list). O(1) time.
2. pop : removes a value at the top of the stack. O(1) time.
3. peek : returns the value at the top of the stack without removing it.

`Coding Problems`
1. Reverse a linked list 
2. Check for balanced parentheses in a string
