A paradigm is a specific collection of concepts and practices that define a field of science
e.g. Newtonian and Relativistic schools are two different paradigms of physics

A programming paradigm is a point of view of the coding realm. It will direct your coding style and technique

you can use one or multiple paradigms in your program. it is best to use the paradigms that the programming language you are using is based on.

3 main programming paradigms
1. imperative
2. declarative
3. logic

imperative programming paradigm is about instructing the computer on what it must do exactly at each step using specific commands. each command changes the computer's state. the sequence of commands that constitutes a program is followed, one after another

imperative programming
1. machine code programming
2. structured programming
3. procedural programming

declarative programming paradigm makes you state your desired result without dealing with every single intricate step that gets you there. It's about declaring what you want, and not how you want it done. In many scenarios, this allows programs to be much shorter and simpler. they are often also easier to read.

declarative programming
1. functional programming

whenever your problem is the solution to a set of logical formulas, you can use logic programming

logic programming isn't very well used in the mainstream, however, it is a thing in artificial intelligence, natural language processing.
