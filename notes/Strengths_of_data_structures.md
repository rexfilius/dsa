<u>Strengths of Data Structures</u>
**List or Array**
insert (at end) = O(1)
delete (at end) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = null

**Linked List (Singly)**
insert (at head) = O(1)
delete (at head) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = null

**Linked List (Doubly)**
insert (head&tail) = O(1)
delete (head&tail) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek (head&tail) = O(1)

**Stack (LIFO style)**
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

**Queue (FIFO style; on a Doubly-Linked-List)**
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1) time

**Map or HashTable**
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = O(1)
peek = null

**Priority Queue (on a Heap)**
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

**Heap**
insert = O(logN)
delete = O(logN)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

**Binary Search Tree**
insert = O(logN)
delete = O(logN)
lookup/search = O(logN)
peek = null

**Graph**
insert = 
delete = 
lookup/search = 
peek = 

**Trie**
insert = 
delete = 
lookup/search = 
peek =
