Quick Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Much like merge sort, it uses the same strategy of divide and conquer. One important feature of quicksort is choosing a pivot point. 

The most important part of implementing quicksort is choosing the right partitioning strategy. 

The partitioning strategies include:
1. Choosing the middle element as a pivot.
2. Lomuto, or choosing the last element as a pivot.
3. Hoare, or choosing the first element as a pivot.
4. Median of three, using the median of three pivot strategy
5. Dutch flag partitioning 

In order of good partitioning (in my understanding) 
(1st) Dutch Flag 
(2nd) Median of three 
(3rd) Lomuto or Hoare
(4th) Middle element as pivot
