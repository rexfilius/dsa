A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure also known as a Binary Heap that you can construct using an array.

`Relevance` 
1. get the max and min element of a collection 
2. Heap sort. 
3. Implementing a priority queue. 
4. Supporting graph algorithms, like Prim’s or Dijkstra’s, with a priority queue. 

`Implementation` 
1. using an array 

`Common operations in a Heap` 
1. insert - O(log n) time 
2. remove - O(log n) time 
3. removeAt - remove a value at an index. O(log n) 
4. search for an element - O(n) time 
5. peek - O(1) time 

`Coding problems` 
1. Find the nth smallest integer in an unsorted array 
2. Merge two heaps 
3. Check if a given array is a minHeap
