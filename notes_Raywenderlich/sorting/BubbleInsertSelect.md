Bubble, Selection and Insertion sort are comparison-based algorithms. The time complexity of these algorithms is O(n-squared). 

**Bubble Sort** repeatedly compares adjacent values and swaps them, if needed, to perform the sort. The larger values in the set will, therefore, bubble up to the end of the collection. 

**Selection Sort** follows the basic idea of bubble sort but improves upon the algorithm by reducing the number of index-swap operations. Selection sort only swaps at the end of each pass. In selection sort, the algo kinda finds the lowest value in the list and starts swapping. When the swapping starts, the indices to inspect keep reducing

**Insertion Sort** is a more useful algorithm. The performance of insertion sort can vary. The more the data is already sorted, the less work it needs to do. Insertion sort has best time complexity of O(n) if the data is already sorted. 

`Coding problems` 
1. Given a list of Comparable elements, bring all instances of a given value in the list to the right side of the array. 
2. Given a list of Comparable elements, return the largest element thatâ€™s a duplicate in the list. 
3. Reverse a list of elements by hand.
