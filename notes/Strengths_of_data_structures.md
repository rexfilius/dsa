<u>Strengths of Data Structures</u>
(1) List or Array
insert (at end) = O(1)
delete (at end) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = null

(2) Stack (LIFO style)
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

(3) Queue (FIFO style; on a Doubly-Linked-List)
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1) time

(4) Linked List (Singly)
insert (at head) = O(1)
delete (at head) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = null

(5) Linked List (Doubly)
insert (head&tail) = O(1)
delete (head&tail) = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek (head&tail) = O(1)

(6) Map or HashTable
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = O(1)
peek = null

(7) Priority Queue (on a Heap)
insert = O(1)
delete = O(1)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

(8) Heap
insert = O(logN)
delete = O(logN)
lookup/search = null
peek = O(1)

(9) Binary Search Tree
insert = O(logN)
delete = O(logN)
lookup/search = O(logN)
peek = null

(10) Trie
insert = 
delete = 
lookup/search = 
peek = 

(11) Graph
insert = 
delete = 
lookup/search = 
peek =
