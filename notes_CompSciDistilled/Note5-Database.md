operations research involves defining an objective to maximize or minimize. it can help maximize objectives like yield, profit, or performance, and minimize objectives like loss, risk or cost

linear optimization problems - are problems where the objective and constraints can be modeled using linear equations

note=> the first step you should take when solving a problem is always look for exisiting algos and methods

schema - combination of fields and restrictions in a database table

normalization - transforming a database with replicated data to one without

transaction - a list of database operations that must be executed ATOMICALLY.  atomic operations are performed in a single step, they cannot half execute

document store - most widely known type of NoSQL database.

in document store, no tables and rows. A dta entry is called a codument. related documents are grouped in a collection

key-value store is the simplest form of organized, persistent data storage. it is mainly used for caching

graph database = data entries are stored as nodes, and relationships as edges. nodes are not tied to a fixed schema and can store data flexibly.

distributed database
1. single master replication
2. multi master replication
3. sharding

if your database queries do not strongly enforce data consistency, they are said to work under eventual consistency

to store data outside of a database in a format that is interoperable across different systems, the data has to go through a process caled serialization

serialization formats
1. SQL
2. Json
3. XML
4. CSV
