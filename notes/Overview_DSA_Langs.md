Map
1. Python
- it is called a 'dictionary'
- I think the default implementation is a LinkedHashMap, because insertion order is preserved in a dictionary.
2. Dart
- there is HashMap, LinkedHashMap and SplayTreeMap. 
- The default map (represented by curly braces {}) is the LinkedHashMap.
- LinkedHashMap preseves the insertion order, HashMap does not.
3. Kotlin
- there is the concept of MutableMap (read&write) and Map(read-only)
- either ways, the default implementation in Kotlin is a LinkedHashMap, that preserves the order of elements insertion when iterating the map.
- LinkedHashMap and HashMap are the implementations of the Map interface in Kotlin.
